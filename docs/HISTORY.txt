0.7 - 18th December 2012
------------------------

- Add a cookieless_signal to allow custom code to be hooked to cookieless sessions
- Pass a created flag for cookieless sessions to the signal

0.6 - 21st November 2012

  cookieless means

0.5 - 14th November 2012
------------------------

- Only rewrite redirect URLs if USE_GET is True and its the same domain

0.4 - 9th November 2012
-----------------------

- Fix issue of not having no_cookies to test in process_request by getting it from urlresolvers
  Now we only check for cookie session where we should, and cookies cannot mess with cookieless sessions

- Use settings.TESTING based on argv to disable, instead of check for servername

0.3 - 7th November 2012

  dummy sessions if an alternative session provider is in use - 
  otherwise cookieless could break other packages tests
- Add server name switch to re-enable test browser for cookieless functional tests
- Change anon user switch to be NO_COOKIE_PERSIST - ie. never use cookie originated sessions - move to process_response
- Make session use cookieless post / get first over cookies, if present 
- Delete request cookies if found in response
- Refactor settings to a dictionary
- Add some tests
- Move fix for non-unicode key to the decrypt method
